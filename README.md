A Monkey Brain for your VNT Turbos, Single VNT > Compound VNT

🐒 Hungry Monkey Control System (v1.4)Torque-on-Demand Compound & Single VNT Turbo ControllerHungry Monkey is an advanced, high-speed turbocharger management framework built for the Teensy 4.1. Originally engineered to manage a 6.0L V12 running compound GTD2873VR VGTs and an EFR 9180 on LPG, it has been abstracted into a universal tool for any VNT (Variable Nozzle Turbine) project.🚀 Core FeaturesDual Mode Logic: Toggle between SINGLE_TURBO and COMPOUND modes with a single flag.Torque-Based Control: Uses CAN-bus torque requests (Nm) and RPM to drive 3D VNT maps.Compound Handover: Seamlessly transitions flow from high-pressure VGTs to a large atmosphere turbo to prevent backpressure choking.Chemical Intercooling: Integrated LPG/Water-Meth injection logic with a "Tabletop" boost feature for high-torque cooling.Triple-Layer Safety: * Overspeed: Real-time compressor RPM monitoring.EMP Ratio: Automated vane opening if Exhaust Manifold Pressure exceeds a safe ratio of Boost (MAP).Surge Damping: Rate-of-change monitoring to prevent compressor surge during rapid spool.🛠 Hardware RequirementsController: Teensy 4.1 (600MHz ARM Cortex-M7).Signal Conditioning: * Teensy is 3.3V logic. You must use logic-level shifters (to 5V/12V) for actuators.LPG/Injectors require a Peak-and-Hold driver board or high-current MOSFET bank.Sensors: * Analog 0-5V (MAP, EMP, EGT).Frequency-based Turbo Speed Sensors (Garrett/BorgWarner).CAN-bus connectivity to the vehicle's ECU.💻 Installation & ConfigurationClone the Repo:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/hungry-monkey.git
Open in Arduino IDE / VS Code (PlatformIO):Ensure you have the FlexCAN_T4 and FreqMeasureMulti libraries installed.Calibrate Your Build:Open the main .ino file and navigate to the USER CALIBRATION SECTION. Adjust the following:SINGLE_TURBO: Set to true or false.VNT_INVERTED: Match your actuator polarity (Hella vs. Garrett).DRIVE_RATIO_LIMIT: Default is 1.5 (EMP/MAP).📈 Pin MappingPinFunctionMode2 & 3VNT Left / RightPWM Output4WastegatePWM Output5 & 8LPG Bank L / RPWM Output (10kHz)6 & 7Comp Speed L / RFrequency InputA0MAP Sensor0-5V AnalogA2EMP Sensor0-5V Analog⚠️ Safety DisclaimerUSE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
